# Evaluation of the ERAP Index and Modern Effects of Redlining
While looking at the ERAP index 2.0 data set that is used to predict the need for emergency rental assistance across the United States, we realized it is not a great predictor of actual evictions unless used in conjunction with actual regional data. We also wondered if the ERAP index’s indicators were the best way to account for evictions at a more regional level rather than countrywide. We then looked at the individual indicators to see what they could tell us about evictions rather than the singular ERAP index value.  By combining ERAP data with Eviction Lab data, we were also able to create another better model to predict evictions statewide.

Historical redlining is a discriminatory practice from the 1940s that determines if people should be able to rent housing in an area and put areas into 5 grades. We wanted to see if this practice still affected society today, so we compared the grades to ERAP and eviction data. This showed that while it is not as much of an effect today, there is still existing systemic inequality in housing and economic conditions, with Grade D areas facing higher rates of housing instability and economic vulnerability, while Grade A areas continue to benefit from higher property values and rents.

The data that we used can be found in the data folder, and the files used to create evrything in our project can be found in the src folder.
